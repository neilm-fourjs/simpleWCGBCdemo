# A simple demo that uses a WebComponent and a custom GBC and a Java source file

Goal is to be able to build and run using:
* Linux command line with a makefile
* Genero Studio

Also to be able to build and deploy as a GAR file and the custom GBC zip.

NOTE: The env.sh script checks the environment and reports the versions found and warns for any missing prerequisites.

Instructions:
* download or clone the repo
* set your Genero environment
* cd simpleWCGBCdemo
* . env.sh
* make

eg:
```
```
